            <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview from a post might go</p>
            <!-- We have 2 elements with the subsection class i.e div & p -->
            <!-- When we want to apply a separate style to the element that  has header as the second class ,
             we chain both the class selectors in css like this:
            .subsection.header {
                color: blue;}-->
                <!-- There shouldn't be any space between .subsection and .header,-->
        </div>

        <!-- This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:-->
        <div>
            <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
            <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
            <!-- .subsection.header {
                    color: red;
                 }
                .subsection#preview {
                    color: blue;
                }       
            In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t 
            be two different types at once -->

<!-- A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the given element type, 
 and the syntax is just the name of the element -->

<!-- Class selectors will select all elements with the given class,
  which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. -->
  <!-- Classes aren’t required to be unique, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want. -->
   <!-- Since whitespace is used to separate class names, we use hyphens for multi-word texts -->
    <!-- period (.) used -->

<!-- ID selectors are similar to class selectors, but they select only one element with the given id.-->
<!-- They select an element with the given id, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element: -->
 <!-- # used -->

<!-- The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one id. 
 An id cannot be repeated on a single page, and the id attribute should not contain any whitespace at all. -->
